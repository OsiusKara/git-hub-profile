# Github Profile Card

This app is part of the 50projects50days course by Traversy Media

## JavaScript part

- Use the Github API to fetch users to get their profile data and display in a card (docs GibHub REST API)
- A seperate request to get the users last 10 repositories
- Error handling (if the user doesn't exist!)
- Using axios (promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js) using it with async/await
- Using try/catch
